DISCLAIMER:

The Vyper Logix Library is required to use this tool however it is not Open Source at this time. Hey, that's the way
it goes with Open Source, sometimes, you almost get everything you want for Free and then you learn there is some 
missing piece you really need to make it all work.  Most of the time you'll be missing the build scripts, this is
quite common; while other times you will be missing the underlying knowledge you will need to make it all work.

So you will be missing a key library.

The good news is... you can build what's missing - shouldn't take you too long, assuming you have the required skill.

The bad news is... without the vision of the original developer you might still be missing something important.

You can, if you wish, License the Vyper Logix Library from Vyper Logix Corp for a nominal fee however it still
won't come with full source code.

In any case, this code is here as a sample of what the original developer is capable of rather than whether or not you
can download and run the code sample(s) shown here.

Enjoy !!!
